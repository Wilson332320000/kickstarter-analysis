# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
	 Louise requested that an analysis is conducted regarding successful and failed Kickstarter campaigns in the United States. 
### Purpose
         Analysis successful and failed compaigns buy launch dates and goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges
      Manipulation of the data located on the parent worksheet" Kickstarter" was required to create a pivot chart and a line chart to visualize and present the data. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
   Successful campaigns were launched in spring and early summer. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    Most successful campaigns did not have significant monetary goals and could meet the goals through several donations or by receiving one large donation. Campaigns with significant monetary goals struggled to meet their goals because they did not receive enough donations.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
   Executing the "COUNTIFS" formula and configuring the " Outcomes-based on Launch Date" pivot tables was a challenge.  

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	The first conclusion is that most successful campaigns in the spring and summer and campaigns launched in the fall or winter tend not to meet thier goals.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	The lower the cost to launch a play increases the probability of play meeting its goals. The more significant the cost decrease the chances of a play meeting their goal. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
        The limitations I found what the data set are, not knowing how are costs determined for "kickoff campaign, " how donations are solicited, who the people are being solicited, and their income.   
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	A stacked column bar chart can be used to depict successful and failed campaigns by months of the year or monetary goals.
